In order to run the system in its current condition the following steps must be followed.
  0. Plug in the camera and arduino
  1. Upload switchCase23.ino to the arduino
  2. roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
  3. Run MasterController.py

FILES:
  -switchCase23: The arduino side of motor control. Takes in a comma separated string
                 "a,x,b,x,c,x,d,x,e,x," where the x's are integers that control the
                 motor intensity and the letters indicate which motor to be triggered.
                 
  -MasterController: A python script that allows the portions of the system to communicate.
                     It subscribes to the camera/image/depth_raw (the depth topic on the camera).
                     From the depth data 5 points from the center of the image vertically and evenly
                     spaced horizontally are used to determine the motor intensity. This is then written
                     to serial using the same format as in switchCase23.
                     
  -asus_image_depth: Used for data collection. Subscribes to the RGB and depth image from the camera.
                     Also subscribes to the accelerometer data. All three time synchronized inputs are
                     saved into a npz.
                     
  -accel_pub_sub: A simple ROS publisher that publishes time stamped motion information. The arduino file
                  that works in tandem with this is AccelGyro.ino which can be found in the previous directory.
